# Setup

copy the file api_keys_TEMPLATE.json into a new file and name it api_keys.json

go to the website(s) for the exchange(s) you plan to use, create an account, and get whatever api keys, endpoints, etc. that you need

open the file and enter the keys into their corresponding location (based on exchanges and stuff)
	(the .gitignore file keeps api_keys.json from getting put online)
